# Learnin-C
My progress as I learn C/C++

This repository will track my progress as I learn both C and C++ throughout the next few months. Coming from lots of practice in Java and Python, I think it will be interesting to see how some of the concepts carry over in higher level languages. Within this repo, I will include any school-assigned C/C++ projects, as well as any personal projects I complete.
