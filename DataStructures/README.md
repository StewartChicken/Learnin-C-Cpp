This folder will contain my implementation of various data structures/algorithms including HashMaps and numerous sorting/search algorithms. I decided to 
implement these data structures before re-approaching my Machine Learning implementation, as I believe these algorithms to be much easier to understand 
(I have implemented many of them before in Java). I also believe that this project will grant me the practice with pointers and arrays that I need to 
successfully build a Machine Learning library in C++.

All Datastructures will utilize integer data types (for now)
