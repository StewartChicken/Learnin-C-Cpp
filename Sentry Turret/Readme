In this project, I created a basic sentry turret using a nerf electric minigun (the brand wasn't actually nerf, but most I've found that most foam-dart shooting
guns can be labled as nerf guns), an arduino, and a stepper motor. The actual build can be seen on my personal website (once the code for that site is complete).
I coded the functionality of the turret in the Arduino IDE (which uses C++), and that's why the project's code is included within this repository. The turret has 
two main modes: a manual control/fire mode, where the user can both aim and fire the turret using a joy-stick module, and a 'sentry' mode, where the turret simply
'guards' an area by panning back and forth over it. I intitially wanted to include some form of AI functionality, so that the turret could shoot at moving targets
or even recognize familiar faces, but, unfortunately, my knowledge of embedded systems did not extend as far as the implementation of facial recognition into 
microcontrollers, and I do not have enough time to study the topic before school starts up. I am taking a computer engineering course during the first semester, and
I am hoping that such a course will give me more insite into the topic. One day, I will return to this project, and include all the cool features I wish to include, 
but for now, it's just a very rough protoype of what's to come!
