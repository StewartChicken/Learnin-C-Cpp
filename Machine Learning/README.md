This Machine Learning folder will contain my C++ implementations of the various ML algorithms. The algorithms I hope to include are Linear Regression,
K-Nearest-Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, K-means clustering and Mean-shift clustering. While I was able to program linear regression relatively quickly
in C++, the complex array/pointer manipulation needed for the KNN (and other) algorithms proved beyond my current comprehension. I will finish these C++ 
implementations in the future and will update this 'readme' file as necessary, but for now I need to learn practice C++ more.
